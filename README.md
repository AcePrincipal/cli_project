#Introduction and Discription 

Hello! This is a CLI program that can assist you in finding a charity to research, follow, donate to, etc. This program achieves this by prompting you to select a category of charities, then provides a list of ten charities that are in that category! You may then select a charity, and it's name, website url, and donations page url will be displayed for you to do with as you please! Enjoy!


#Install Instructions
